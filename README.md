# Hey there üëã

I'm a Full Stack Developer with substantial experience across multiple technology domains. My work spans from modern web applications to backend systems and DevOps automation. I've specialized in IoT ecosystems, single-board computers, and networking technologies - implementing professional solutions with LoRa, Zigbee, 60GHz wireless, and mesh networks. I've also worked extensively with industrial protocols like SNMP and Modbus, and have hands-on experience with hardware interfaces including I2C, UART, and basic soldering skills.

Linux has been central to my professional work - I've developed and deployed custom systems with Yocto for NXP and Rockchip processors and have comprehensive experience across the entire stack from bootloaders to frontend. My technical background allows me to bridge hardware and software domains effectively, creating integrated solutions that perform reliably in production environments.

_Quick disclaimer: While I've listed many technologies here, I'm not claiming to be an expert in everything. Some I know inside and out, others I've used in professional contexts to varying degrees. What matters is that I can effectively leverage these technologies to build robust solutions._
