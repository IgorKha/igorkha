### Hi there üëã

I'm a Full Stack Developer with expertise in modern web technologies, backend systems, and DevOps practices. I'm passionate about IoT, single-board computers, and networking technologies including wired and wireless solutions (LoRa, Zigbee, 60GHz wireless, mesh networks). I have extensive experience with Linux systems and building products on this platform, including custom builds with Yocto for NXP and Rockchip processors. My experience spans the full stack - from bootloaders to frontend button colors.

_While this tech stack might seem extensive, I acknowledge that my knowledge depth varies across technologies - some I know deeply, others I've worked with to varying degrees. What matters is that I have hands-on experience with each and can leverage them effectively in projects._
